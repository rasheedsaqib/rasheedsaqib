### Hi there, I'm Saqib Rasheed 👋

I'm a full-stack developer who enjoys working with frontend technologies. My passion lies in crafting beautiful and intuitive user interfaces with JavaScript and TypeScript. I'm a huge fan of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and always strive to write clean, maintainable code that is thoroughly tested.
